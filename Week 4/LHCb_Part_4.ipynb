        "*  One explanation for the effect *might* be a detector effect. This means we might treat particles and anti-particles differently. For this reason, we turn the magnet polarity half way through data-taking and always record our data seperately. So in order to verify this, we need to check the two datasets - the magnet up data (which we used so far) and the magnet down data (available here http://opendata.cern.ch/record/4900/files/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root ). In the end you can compare the two figures from the two data sets.\n",
        "* If you're feeling **really** adventurous you could look for this effect in a different decay - $B^+ \\rightarrow K^+\\pi^-\\pi^-$. Here you can look for events with good percentages of one Kaon and two pions, and then compare the PID values of each to decide which of the particles should be the Kaon, then conduct similar steps. \n",
